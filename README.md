# live-weather

This is one of the projects where I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and BootStrap. In short, it is a Weather app that fetches live weather data from Open Weather Map API. It pulls weather data from OpenWeatherMap API based on what user input in the country text field. Based on user's input, the application pulls country's capital from PIXABAY API, and display current forcast details returned from OpenWeatherMap API.
